Hey! There's a lot more stuff going on in the editor now.
The editor has been improved a bunch so here's some new things you can try out:

- Try changing the speed of a Missile Launcher!
(Really slow rockets are real in these days)
- Try hovering your cursor over the "?" Icon
(It can be helpful sometimes)

- Try Publishing a new Stage!

Theme: "Corners and Edges"

When publishing, click on the "Weekly" tag.
This will automatically enter your stage into the weekly editor challenge!
